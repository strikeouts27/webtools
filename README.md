This project will hold the work that I have done for the Dallas College ITSE-1301-23701
Web Design Course!

The course is taught by Stephen Heard

IN this project we were assigned to a fictional development team called Launch Studio as
a web development intern.

AI was used for some of the images in this project.

Per Professor Heard:
META-> AI TAG
Readme -> AI TAG

You have to explain why you used AI.
If it does not work, as a student I am expected to take the fall for it because I chose to use it.
AI use is allowed in this course.
