This project will hold the work that I have done for the Dallas College ITSE-1301-23701 
Web Design Course! 

The course is taught by Stephen Heard

IN this project we were assigned to a fictional development team called Launch Studio as 
a web development intern. 

AI was used for some of the images in this project.
