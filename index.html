            <!-- <p>I suppose the apple craze and shark tank took hold of me. Around that time they had introduced the ipad and iphone and I said to myself wouldn't it be great if I could create something wonderful that changed the world just as they did.
            I hold the belief that in order to run a successful business you must really be excellent in all aspects of the business from your engineering of the products to your marketing and customer service to your ability to please your shareholders. I decided that having customers and high sales solved everything so I went the Marketing route.
            Thats not to say it is impossible. Indeed if you are able to diagnose the customers need with probing questions and convince them to sign up for discounts you can bring back the need at the time of the sale and help them get a customized plan to fit their needs in the moment.
            <strong><em class="compensation">And if you are great at sales you get compensated very well for it.</em></strong></p>

            <h2>My Career</h2>

            <p>Here are the 3 reasons I decided to start studying programming. I wanted to build things that I could be proud of. I dream of being a game designer in my retirement or build useful tools and apps that people could use. I could take this skill anywhere and build a career and family around it. I am a nerd. Computer programming is a job where nerds gather. I have always felt at place at the different programming groups I have joined. Nerds are very intelligent and polite.

                <p>I remember it well. I was an inside sales representative at State Farm until they slashed our sales commisons. I looked around at the other departments and realized I did not have any desire for claims or underwriting.
                I was talking to a friend of mine and he showed me codecaddemy. I started doing exercises and I thought this career path was worth getting into. I studied at Nucamp Coding Bootcamp. They introducted my to HTML, CSS, and Javascript and Python.</p>
